      <title>Privacy Policy Update</title>

      <description>In 2019&amp;rsquo;s site update, analytics were ripped out while I looked for a more privacy-focused option. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that the site now uses privacy-respecting Plausible Analytics, and I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the privacy policy to reflect this.
 Plausible Analytics is an open-source project dedicated to making web analytics more privacy-friendly. Our mission is to reduce corporate surveillance by providing an alternative web analytics tool which doesn’t come from the AdTech world.</description>

      <title>Death by a Thousand Cuts</title>

      <description>Lately, there’s been a lot of handwringing about the long-term impact of a daily treat like a cup of coffee. The Times got this completely wrong yesterday, pushing people deeper into a trap that they should run away from. And the Washington Post points out that the number of people getting a loan for their wedding is skyrocketing. This is a problem.

      <description>After a (much longer than expected) hiatus from posting here, the site is back with a fresh new design!
There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been very much going on for a while, but that&amp;rsquo;s changing. Dropped Bits is a one-person shop, and the bulk of my time has been taken up by Other Things™ for some time now. I&amp;rsquo;ve since managed to cull lots of those projects, so that I can dedicate more time here.</description>

      <title>Privacy Policy</title>

      <description>Our approach to privacy is pretty straightforward—we avoid collecting private information if we don&amp;rsquo;t have to, and if we do, we respect and protect it.
It&amp;rsquo;s important, however, to consider the difference between private and anonymous data.
Anonymous data Analytics We&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to use Plausible Analytics to track usage of websites (including droppedbits.com) because it does a great job of providing useful data without, in their own words, &amp;ldquo;collecting any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII), without using cookies and while respecting the privacy of [our] website visitors&amp;rdquo; — this means that you&amp;rsquo;re not tracked across devices, websites, and apps.</description>

      <title>HoneyJar</title>

      <description>HoneyJar is a future-value calculator inspired by one of Aesop&amp;rsquo;s fables:
 A jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out on the table. The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large number of Flies buzzing around. They did not wait for an invitation. No, indeed; they settled right down, feet and all, to gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey.</description>

      <description>Per helps you shop smarter by figuring out what gets you more for your money.
At its heart, Per is a price-per-unit calculator. Just give it the price and quantity for two options, tap the Compare button, and let Per figure out which one gives you the best deal.
Of course, you can do that kind of math with a basic calculator app. Per brings a few neat little tricks to the comparison-shopping party, though.</description>

      <title>Free non-trial for apps</title>
      <link>https://droppedbits.com/news/2015/05/02/free-non-trial/</link>

      <guid>https://droppedbits.com/news/2015/05/02/free-non-trial/</guid>
      <description>On Friday, both Per and HoneyJar were made free for a limited time.
Developers can&amp;rsquo;t offer free trials to their customers on the App Store, and customers aren&amp;rsquo;t always willing to commit dollars to new apps. That&amp;rsquo;s normal. Even though most apps cost less than a cup of coffee, at least a cup of coffee is something that people know and understand—everyone knows what a cup of coffee offers and can easily decide if it&amp;rsquo;s worth the price.</description>

      <title>Per v1.1 released</title>

      <guid>https://droppedbits.com/news/2015/02/23/per-v11-released/</guid>
      <description>A few little tweaks, enhancements, and bug fixes for you in this new version of Per:
See all the things Some view adjustments for iPhone 4s and iPhone 5/5c/5s users now put all the fields on screen, for more happy-tappy UI goodness.
Globalization, yo You can now choose the type of non-metric units used in your area (US vs. UK) from the Info page.
Nuke the site from orbit (it&amp;rsquo;s the only way to be sure) You can now clear the text from all the fields with one button tap, from the new Clear button (⊗) in the keyboard toolbar.</description>

      <title>On the App Store, developers can&#39;t hear you scream.</title>

      <description>A note if you&amp;rsquo;re leaving a review for any app on the App Store:
 Reviews are very helpful for letting the world know what you think of an app. Additionally, the more reviews an app gets, the higher it ranks when someone searches the App Store, which improves its visibility and &amp;ldquo;discoverability&amp;rdquo;. Developers of the app can&amp;rsquo;t reply to your reviews. So, if your review contains some kind of support request (&amp;ldquo;the app crashes when I do X&amp;rdquo;), the developer can&amp;rsquo;t get in touch with you to help.</description>

      <title>Hello, Per.</title>
      <link>https://droppedbits.com/news/2015/02/09/hello-per/</link>

      <description>Pop quiz, hotshot: you&amp;rsquo;re in produce section at the supermarket, and you need carrots for tonight&amp;rsquo;s dinner.
Raw carrots are $1.09 per pound. Washed baby carrots are $1.99 for 907 grams.
What do you do?
WHAT DO YOU DO?
 Per was created to answer exactly that question. It was inspired by my wife, who literally turned to me at the grocery store and said,
 &amp;ldquo;You should write an app that tells me which of these options is a better deal.</description>

      <title>Honeyjar v1.1 released</title>

      <guid>https://droppedbits.com/news/2014/10/09/honeyjar-v11-released/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just released v1.1 of HoneyJar, a free update now available on the App Store.
This version adds support for iOS 8 and fixes a display bug on the iPhones 6, along with a smattering of other small bug fixes and performance enhancements.</description>

      <title>Hello, HoneyJar.</title>
      <link>https://droppedbits.com/news/2014/09/04/hello-honeyjar/</link>

      <guid>https://droppedbits.com/news/2014/09/04/hello-honeyjar/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to announce that HoneyJar, our first app for iPhone and iPod touch, has been released for sale.

You give every dollar you spend a job, whether you realize it or not.
In fact—if you want to take it to the extreme—you can argue that every dollar that isn&amp;rsquo;t working for you, is working against you. It&amp;rsquo;s keeping you from an early retirement. It&amp;rsquo;s keeping you from financial independence.</description>

      <title>Hello, World.</title>
      <link>https://droppedbits.com/news/2014/08/25/hello-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2014 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://droppedbits.com/news/2014/08/25/hello-world/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to announce that—after what feels like an eternity—our first app for iPhone, HoneyJar, was submitted on Sunday for approval to the App Store team.
This marks a pretty big milestone, obviously. Dropped Bits incorporated almost three years ago, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming, too. And it&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting road so far, full of inspiration, hard decisions, learning, sacrifice, and happy little victories.
Turns out, going from idea to shipping your Minimum Viable Product isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as you&amp;rsquo;d think—especially when your organization is having an identity crisis.</description>
