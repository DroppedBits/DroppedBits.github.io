<h1>December 2021 Updates</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2022-01-15">15 January, 2022</time>
</span>
<p>Welcome back to another edition of Dispatches from Dropped Bits HQ! I hope your holidays were as good as they could be, given All Thisâ„¢.</p>
<p>This month, on top of a quick recap of 2021, I want to talk a bit about where I see Dropped Bits going in 2022. January marks the company&rsquo;s ten-year anniversary â€” something that kinda snuck up on me, if I&rsquo;m honest. I&rsquo;d imagined some kind of fanfare, along with a whole new webpage to mark the occasion, and thatâ€¦ didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, here we are, a decade later, still publishing apps on the App Store. That&rsquo;s pretty cool. ðŸ”Ÿ</p>
<h2 id="december-in-review">December In Review</h2>
<p>There was a holiday sale between December 24<sup>th</sup> and January 1<sup>st</sup>, which didn&rsquo;t really move the numbers much from the month before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://droppedbits.com/per?utm_campaign=202201update&amp;utm_source=dbblog&amp;utm_medium=referral">Per</a></strong>: 5 downloads (last month: 4)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/?utm_campaign=202201update&amp;utm_source=dbblog&amp;utm_medium=referral">Thought Detox</a></strong>: 6 downloads (last month: 6)</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenues and proceeds on sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US dollars.</p>
<ul>
<li>App Sales (what customers paid Apple): USD$8.98</li>
<li>App Proceeds (what Apple pays me): USD$7.62</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2021-in-review">2021 In Review</h2>
<p>In lieu of the usual App Updates section, I wanted to give an overview of how last year went.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last month, 2021 was a marked change from the first eight years of the company&rsquo;s existence. For one, I actually put a bit more time and effort into marketing, getting write-ups in <a href="https://www.imore.com/detox-your-mind-rumination-busting-iphone-app">iMore</a> for the launch of Thought Detox, which I announced on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/thought-detox">Product Hunt</a>. I put more intention into cutting unnecessary business expenses, to get me to my goal of breaking even (I will be reviewing this on a quarterly basis going forward, and there are already a couple of new services I plan on cutting).</p>
<p>Total app sales for the business (i.e., what customers paid Apple) amount to USD$336, with app revenues (i.e., what Apple paid me) of USD$274 â€”Â a little more than the 15% App Store cut for small businesses, due to foreign exchange fluctuation, I guess.</p>
<p>Actual cash deposited to my business chequing account was CAD$331, which is interesting: I can pretty much count USD$1 in gross sales as CAD$1 in net revenues. Of course, that will change depending on the USD/CAD foreign exchange rate.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that&rsquo;s all driven by Thought Detox â€”Â primarily, from the launch (USD$178 in proceeds for 127 downloads, or 65% of total proceeds for 2021). Maybe it was silly to set pre-orders at USD$0.99 for a week before launch, though that only really accounted for 31 downloads.</p>
<p>Obviously, this isn&rsquo;t <em>close</em> to the kind of money that can support you, but looking back on the last decade, there was only one other year where I had <em>any</em> net revenues: in 2015, when I launched Per, for a total of USD$2.78.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. App sales in 2021 made 100 times more income than they did for <em>the rest of the company&rsquo;s existence until then</em>.</p>
<p>(A note to any iOS developers reading this: marketing works.)</p>
