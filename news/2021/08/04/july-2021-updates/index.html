<h1>July 2021 Updates</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2021-08-04">4 August, 2021</time>
</span>
<p>July continued to be a quiet month for sales, so I&rsquo;ve decided to think a little bit bigger with the business and have moved some contracting work in. There are a few advantages to doing this for my particular situation, but as far as my goal of making the business profitable this year, it feels like a bit of a cheat — the goal was to make the <em>app</em> business profitable, and so I&rsquo;m going to continue to focus on that part here.</p>
<p>That said, having a little bit more money flowing into the business gives me a bit more breathing room month-to-month as far as what I think of as &ldquo;long-game&rdquo; expenses — things relating to the app business, but that won&rsquo;t pay off until later. I&rsquo;m trying to be careful about adding such expenses; it&rsquo;s easy to find a justification for spending money, but every dollar that goes out is coming from a very limited supply of dollars coming in.</p>
<p>So with all that said, here&rsquo;s what the download numbers looked like for July:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://droppedbits.com/apps/per">Per</a>: 7 downloads (-13% ▽)</li>
<li><a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/">Thought Detox</a>: 3 downloads (-25% ▽)</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenues and proceeds on June sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US Dollars.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues, July 2021: USD$8.14 (what customers paid Apple)</li>
<li>Proceeds, July 2021: USD$6.35 (what Apple pays me)</li>
<li>Expenses, July 2021: CAD$38.21 (approximately USD$30.46)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sales were down again in July, and I didn&rsquo;t release any updates to apps. There was one larger expense: I registered a domain name for an idea I had, which is what I mean by &ldquo;long-game&rdquo; expenses. Were it not for that, my expenses for July would have been CAD$12.17 (approximately USD$9.70), so a loss of a couple of bucks.</p>
<h2 id="whats-coming-up">What&rsquo;s Coming Up</h2>
<h3 id="thought-detox">Thought Detox</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finished, but not yet released, the translation of Thought Detox to French — it does need a little bit of a tweak to the UI, as I mentioned <a href="https://droppedbits.com/news/2021/07/21/updates-updates-updates/">last time</a>. I think I spend a little bit too much time trying to pack more stuff into updates than I should, so I&rsquo;m going to make that tweak and submit it for review ASAP, then move on to making sure things work properly in the iOS 15 betas.</p>
<p>I was hoping to also bundle in some more updates, but it&rsquo;s already been months since I shipped anything. There&rsquo;s always the worry that people will think the app has been abandoned, and regular updates help with that.</p>
<h3 id="per">Per</h3>
<p>Speaking of apps that people think have been abandoned, I&rsquo;ve gotten some preliminary designs for the Per rewrite! We&rsquo;re taking a fun, playful approach to the app and I&rsquo;m looking forward to tackling that. Will it launch before the end of the year? Who knows!</p>
<h3 id="one-more-thing">One More Thing</h3>
<p>I have a few other little projects in my backlog that I&rsquo;m aiming to tackle soon. The tricky part is, of course, trying to figure out how to move everything forward at the same time — this isn&rsquo;t my full-time work since it can&rsquo;t support me financially (yet), but it is what I love to do, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to tackling these things.</p>
<p>As always, more TK.</p>
