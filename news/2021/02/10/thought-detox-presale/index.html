<h1>Thought Detox Pre-Launch Sale!</h1>

<p>Thought Detox is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/thought-detox/id1534491093">available for pre-order</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtdetox.app/assets/images/lifestyle.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The app launches on the App Store on Monday, February 15<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but readers can pre-order it <em>today</em> at 65% off the launch price.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yes ‚Äî¬†Thought Detox will be a paid app. I don&rsquo;t think anyone believes that people shouldn&rsquo;t get paid for their work, but some business models are harder to accept than others.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s agree straight away that supporting the app with advertising isn&rsquo;t a good fit here. I just can&rsquo;t reconcile &ldquo;protecting your privacy&rdquo; with &ldquo;selling your data to advertisers,&rdquo; and¬†my personal stance is that privacy has to be protected at all costs in an app of this nature.</p>
<p>Second, &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; pricing ‚Äîwhere the app is available for free, but some features are locked behind an in-app purchase‚Äî doesn&rsquo;t make sense for Thought Detox. I didn&rsquo;t build it to be half an app, and so it&rsquo;d be a bad experience for users that decide against unlocking the full app.</p>
<p>Then there are subscriptions. Again ‚Äî¬†I just don&rsquo;t see Thought Detox fitting this model. I have thoughts on subscriptions in general, and I do think they make sense for <em>some</em> apps, but not this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky thing to balance. The time and effort put into launching and maintaining an app isn&rsquo;t trivial; it&rsquo;s hundreds or thousands of hours (or more!) of effort, trying to build something that will improve someone&rsquo;s life in some way. On the other hand, no one owes me a dime for building this.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://thought-detox.glitch.me/">check out the (free!) web app</a> and decide that&rsquo;s good enough for you, great! I hope you find it helpful. If you want a bit more, or just want to support my work in some way, I&rsquo;d love it if you bought the app. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/thought-detox/id1534491093">pre-order now</a> at a special price of USD$0.99,¬†jumping to USD$2.99 soon after the official launch on Monday.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing-retiring-honeyjar">One More Thing: Retiring HoneyJar</h2>
<p>Another little bit of app-related news: <a href="https://droppedbits.com/apps/honeyjar">HoneyJar</a>, my first iPhone app, will be removed from the App Store next month.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for that ‚Äî¬†it hasn&rsquo;t gotten updated in years, the codebase is a mess, and frankly I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much of a market for it. There&rsquo;s a recent one-star review for it that implies the usefulness of it isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair enough.</p>
<p>It was a great learning experience, but I don&rsquo;t have the time or, frankly, the interest to update it. It&rsquo;s made a total of $10 since it was released as a paid app in 2014, so I think it&rsquo;s safe to say no one else has much interest in it either. üôÇ</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll remain available on the App Store for the 2,736 users that have already downloaded it, but it&rsquo;ll otherwise live as an archived-app page on the website.</p>
