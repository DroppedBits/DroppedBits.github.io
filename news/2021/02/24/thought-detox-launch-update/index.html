<h1>Thought Detox Launch: A Retrospective</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2021-02-24">24 February, 2021</time>
</span>
<p>Thought Detox has now been available for sale on the App Store since February 15th, with pre-orders opening one week before that. I&rsquo;m going to focus the discussion on the following timeframes:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-14 February (pre-order week)</li>
<li>15-21 February (launch week)</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to that, I was sharing some of my work on the app via <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeloStavrow">my personal Twitter account</a>, and set up a beta-testing program via <a href="http://airport.community/">AppAirport</a>. I didn&rsquo;t get a whole lot of feedback from public beta testing, but it was useful to check that the app wasn&rsquo;t crashing anywhere.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ll write more about my beta-testing approach another day, and what I&rsquo;ve learned from this launch.)</p>
<h2 id="february-8-14-pre-order-week">February 8-14: Pre-Order Week</h2>
<p>First, the numbers: there were 31 pre-orders of the app at the pre-launch sale price of US$0.99 during the week. The vast majority of this came from the U.S. — 22 units, or nearly 71%.</p>
<p>Best I can tell, nearly all pre-orders came from this tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trying something a bit different with <a href="https://twitter.com/ThoughtDetoxApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ThoughtDetoxApp</a> — it&#39;s now available for pre-order, at 2/3rd off, and will be going up to its full price two days after launch. <a href="https://t.co/GMBL8351Ul">https://t.co/GMBL8351Ul</a></p>&mdash; Angelo Stavrow (@AngeloStavrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeloStavrow/status/1358765604178710528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It was retweeted by some lovely people, with significantly larger audiences than I have. All in all, it had over 27K impressions, and 286 engagements on Twitter.</p>
<p>According to Twitter&rsquo;s analytics for the <a href="https://twitter.com/ThoughtDetoxApp">@ThoughtDetoxApp account</a>, 104 people clicked through to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/thought-detox/id1534491093">App Store product page</a> — I&rsquo;m fairly certain most of those came through my retweet above.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I sent a few emails to some press contacts I found. These included invites to test the beta, as well as promo codes to download the app to try it out for free. Best I can tell from the App Store data I get, two of those promo codes were claimed, but none joined the beta program. I got one reply, noting that the app would be included in <a href="https://club.macstories.net/">Club MacStories</a>' weekly list of app debuts next week. That was cool!</p>
<h2 id="february-15-21-launch-week">February 15-21: Launch Week</h2>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll start with the numbers!</p>
<ul>
<li>Total units: 84 units</li>
<li>Total sales: US$88.08</li>
<li>Total proceeds: US$71.52</li>
</ul>
<p>On Monday, all pre-orders converted to sales, so naturally that was the best day for sales. There&rsquo;s always a spike on the day you launch an app, which then tapers off to some relatively-consistent daily average afterwards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/news/daily-unit-sales_launch-week.png" alt="Daily units during the launch week, annotated with significant events."></p>
<p>Monday also saw the launch of the app&rsquo;s <a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/">official website</a>, as well as the app&rsquo;s <a href="https://producthunt.com/posts/thought-detox">launch on Product Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Through some weird bug, the app initially launched on Product Hunt on the 15th, but then the site decided to push that to the 16th and wouldn&rsquo;t let me change it back. That&rsquo;s okay, though, since it triggered a kind of secondary launch-day effect  on the 16th.</p>
<p>On the 19th, the Club MacStories newsletter went out, and this saw the second largest day for sales.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-well">What Went Well?</h2>
<p>In a single week, Thought Detox has generated about three and a half times more revenue than my other apps, combined. That&rsquo;s not a very fair comparison, as my other apps haven&rsquo;t been updated in a while, and have been free for most of their availability on the App Store. But as far as launch weeks go, the comparison holds, and I think that&rsquo;s largely due to one key difference: I actually did some marketing this time!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also generally happier with the overall <em>polish</em> of the launch (except for a couple of things I&rsquo;ll list below). Coordinating three Twitter accounts, two websites, the App Store, press emails, and the app itself wasn&rsquo;t easy, but I think it came together pretty well, all told.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-have-gone-better">What Could Have Gone Better?</h2>
<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m thrilled with the way the app&rsquo;s website turned out, but I didn&rsquo;t do a great job of managing this subproject. It felt like we were working on it right up to the last minute, and it was more stressful than it needed to be.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t put enough time and effort into the App Store product page. I think using app preview videos would be more appealing than static screenshots to folks that visit the page. I&rsquo;m going to improve them for the next release.</li>
<li>I would have liked to have had the app ready for sale (but not yet released) for a while longer, so that I could give journalists more time to check it out. That, combined with better media to get a feel for the app, might have gotten more  press attention (but maybe not, I can&rsquo;t say for sure).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m already working on the next release of Thought Detox, and beyond a bit of &ldquo;bug fixes and performance improvements&rdquo; work, two key things I&rsquo;m tackling include getting it ready for localization (the app is only available in English right now), and adding something to better interact with beta testers. I&rsquo;d like to involve them more in the product-management process, so prompting them to participate in surveys might get me a little more feedback.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One More Thing</h2>
<p>A reminder that <a href="https://droppedbits.com/apps/honeyjar">HoneyJar</a>, my first iOS app, is being sunset at the end of February. It will still be available for download if you already purchased/downloaded the app, but it will no longer be available for new users.</p>
