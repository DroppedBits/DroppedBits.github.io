<h1>January 2021 Updates</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2021-02-03">3 February, 2021</time>
</span>
<p>In the interest of transparency, I&rsquo;ve decided that the first update of every month should include a recap of how things went the month before. Let me know if you find this useful!</p>
<h2 id="recap-january-2021">Recap: January 2021</h2>
<p>Most of my time was spent working on the Thought Detox launch (more on this below). I&rsquo;ve been telling myself that &ldquo;release is imminent&rdquo; for a couple of months now, but there&rsquo;s always something more to do! The app is nearly complete, so I&rsquo;m turning my focus now to building the <a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/">landing page</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the download numbers looked like for January:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://droppedbits.com/apps/honeyjar/">HoneyJar</a>: 20 downloads</li>
<li><a href="https://droppedbits.com/apps/per/">Per</a>: 7 downloads</li>
</ul>
<p>Because neither app has been updated in <em>a very long time</em>, they&rsquo;re both free apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues, January 2021: $0.00 CAD</li>
<li>Expenses, January 2021: $30.00 CAD</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thought-detox-updates">Thought Detox Updates</h2>
<p>Thought Detox is getting closer and closer to launch! I&rsquo;ve released build 197 to TestFlight today that closes out a few bug fixes and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;Connect To Apple Health&rdquo; button size is now consistent across all screen sizes.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Text &amp; Motion Effects&rdquo; toggle has been split to control text effects and motion effects separately.</li>
<li>The animations are disabled if Motion Effects are turned off in the Settings sheet.</li>
<li>On first launch, the app will set Motion Effects to respect the system setting for Reduce Motion.</li>
<li>Some minor layout issues have been fixed.</li>
<li>Widgets now update to reflect changes in the Text Effects setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for the beta on <a href="https://app.airport.community/app/recDBUgCR519wJUVd">Airport</a>.</p>
<h2 id="product-updates">Product Updates</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://droppedbits.com/">home page</a> for Dropped Bits states that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;crafting tools that help you make smarter decisions about your money&rdquo; — this used to be true, but now that I&rsquo;m working on a self-care app, it&rsquo;s not quite accurate anymore.</p>
<p>That has me thinking about where I want to take the business. As I mentioned above, I haven&rsquo;t updated the existing apps on the App Store for at least five years; I&rsquo;m not charging money for them, because I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;d be fair to my customers.</p>
<p>Both Per and HoneyJar have each had around 2,800 downloads. The apps still work on modern iPhones, but are they worth keeping around?</p>
<p>Last year I kicked off work rewriting Per from the ground up — before Apple released a major update to SwiftUI, its declarative framework for building iOS and Mac apps. I&rsquo;m now deeply rethinking what Per and HoneyJar could look like as modern, cross-platform (i.e., iOS and Mac) apps. But these apps have never been especially popular (not that I&rsquo;ve really marketed them), and given that the audience for them is people looking to optimize their spending, I doubt I could really charge anything.</p>
<p>Of the two, I do think Per has real utility, and I use it all the time when I&rsquo;m at the supermarket. The rewrite is already underway, so I may as well continue that. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what the business model will be, but existing users shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay to keep any current functionality.</p>
<p>But HoneyJar doesn&rsquo;t really do more than offer a visual future-value calculator, and not a very powerful one at that, so I think it may be time to retire it.</p>
