<h1>October 2021 Updates</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2021-11-15">15 November, 2021</time>
</span>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 15th of November, and you know what that means — a monthly update on how things are going at Dropped Bits HQ!</p>
<p>October is always an interesting month, at least here in Montreal. The city feels like it&rsquo;s got one foot in summer, and the other in winter; there&rsquo;s a sort-of-refusal to accept that the heat and daylight we&rsquo;ve been enjoying since late May is winding down, and at the same time some excitement kicking off preparation for the first snow and the holidays.</p>
<p>I like preparation work. I bought a new parka, so that I can continue my walks by the lake in the depths of winter. I ordered a planner for 2022, so that I can keep on top of things. And I dug a bit deeper into getting things ready for the launch of <a href="https://droppedbits.com/per?utm_campaign=202111update&amp;utm_source=dbblog&amp;utm_medium=referral">Per</a> 2.0, too.</p>
<p>Writing the code is such a small part of launching an app. I have to rewrite the marketing page, and work on the App Store product page. I have to figure out what&rsquo;s going to be free in the app, and what will require an in-app purchase. I have to figure out what kind of analytics and crash reporting I want to integrate. I have press kits to assemble and tech journalists to email.</p>
<p>All of this while I also try to write the app itself, maintain <a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/?utm_campaign=202111update&amp;utm_source=dbblog&amp;utm_medium=referral">Thought Detox</a>, keep on top of the business' bookkeeping, &amp;cet. — it&rsquo;s a lot, but I enjoy it.</p>
<h2 id="october-in-review">October In Review</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a fair bit of design work to be completed for Per, but there&rsquo;s also been some progress on the app rewrite.</p>
<p>I also got access to Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/">Xcode Cloud</a> beta at the end of October. This allows me to automate a lot of things while I work, including running tests and releasing new versions of Per to beta testers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the download numbers looked like for October:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per: 3 downloads (last month: 3)</li>
<li>Thought Detox: 3 downloads (last month: 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenues and proceeds on sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US dollars.</p>
<ul>
<li>App Sales (what customers paid Apple): USD$9.23</li>
<li>App Proceeds (what Apple pays me): USD$7.59</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a whole lot of money, but it&rsquo;s better than the zero dollars in revenues that came in last month!</p>
<h2 id="app-updates">App Updates</h2>
<h3 id="thought-detox">Thought Detox</h3>
<p>Given the focus on Per, there were no updates to Thought Detox in October. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the low sales figures, and so I&rsquo;m experimenting with a price drop: since November 5<sup>th</sup>, the price of Thought Detox was dropped from USD$2.99 to USD$1.99! I may bump that back up, maybe even above the original price, when I finish work on the iPad and/or Mac app. So if you haven&rsquo;t yet gotten the app, lock in the lower price now by <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1534491093?pt=973725&amp;ct=dbblog&amp;mt=8">buying it on the App Store</a>.</p>
<h3 id="per">Per</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to integrate (privacy-focused) analytics into the app, which will anonymously determine things like what features people tend to use, what kinds of errors they might run into, and so on. The service I&rsquo;ve settled on is <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com">TelemetryDeck</a>, because it&rsquo;s run by a small independent team of two whose data-privacy values align with mine. It&rsquo;s still in beta, but I&rsquo;m excited to see it grow.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last month, Per 2 will be a free update for everyone. It will be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id922693504?pt=973725&amp;ct=dbblog&amp;mt=8">free to download on the App Store</a> with a bunch of new features, some of which will require an in-app purchase to unlock.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One More Thing</h2>
<p>As I mentioned last month, I&rsquo;m making some minor changes and fixes to the Dropped Bits website. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="https://droppedbits.com/contact-us?utm_campaign=202111update&amp;utm_source=dbblog&amp;utm_medium=referral">reach out</a> if something seems to be broken!</p>
