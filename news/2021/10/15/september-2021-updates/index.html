<h1>September 2021 Updates</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2021-10-15">15 October, 2021</time>
</span>
<p>Hello, friends!</p>
<p>If you’ve been reading these regularly, you might have noticed that there was no first-Wednesday-of-the-month post last week, nor was there a mid-month update in September. There are two reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, there hasn&rsquo;t been much to report. September was pretty quiet, aside from releasing a very early, mostly-incomplete version of <a href="https://droppedbits.com/per?utm_campaign=202110update&amp;utm_source=dbblog&amp;utm_medium=referral">Per</a>&rsquo;s redesign to internal testers.</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;ve decided it makes sense to send out just one update a month. Most of my time goes towards consulting work (gotta pay the bills, after all!), with only a couple of hours a week set aside for working on my own apps, dealing with Business Stuff™, and writing these updates—so from now on, I&rsquo;ll be writing a single update on the 15<sup>th</sup> of every month.</p>
<p>And hey, today <em>is</em> the 15th, so here you go!</p>
<h2 id="september-in-review">September In Review</h2>
<p><a href="https://thoughtdetox.app?utm_campaign=202110update&amp;utm_source=dbblog&amp;utm_medium=referral">Thought Detox</a> v2021.05 was released on September 3<sup>rd</sup>, and the update focused mainly on translating the app to French and making a few minor design changes. The app&rsquo;s &ldquo;Back To School&rdquo; sale continued from the end of August through to the 12<sup>th</sup> of September, but it didn&rsquo;t really generate any sales.</p>
<p>Here’s what the download numbers looked like for September:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per: 3 downloads (no change)</li>
<li>Thought Detox: 0 downloads (-100% ▽)</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenues and proceeds on sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US Dollars.</p>
<ul>
<li>App Sales (what customers paid Apple): USD$0.00</li>
<li>App Proceeds (what Apple pays me): USD$0.00</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that consulting income is making the business profitable, I&rsquo;ve decided against continuing to include monthly expenses in these updates — frankly, for expenses like software, it can be a bit tricky to determine if it should count against app revenues or consulting fees, so it doesn&rsquo;t really add value to include it.</p>
<h2 id="app-updates">App Updates</h2>
<h3 id="thought-detox">Thought Detox</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a whole lot going on with Thought Detox lately. Sales are pretty low, but then I haven&rsquo;t been doing much to market the app at all, so that&rsquo;s not entirely unexpected. I still want to bring the app to iPad (and maybe even macOS), but I&rsquo;m setting it aside temporarily to work on Per.</p>
<p>If you need a private place to work through negative thoughts, consider getting <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1534491093?pt=973725&amp;ct=dbblog&amp;mt=8">Thought Detox on the App Store</a>.</p>
<h3 id="per">Per</h3>
<p>The redesign of Per is, as I mentioned above, underway. The designer I’m working with has some really solid ideas on product features, and I’m loving the new look we’re bringing to an app that:</p>
<ol>
<li>hasn’t had an update in over five years, and</li>
<li>didn’t look all that great to begin with.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new version of Per will be a free upgrade with an IAP purchase to unlock some new, premium features. I don’t really have a timeline for it, but I’ll be sharing more here and on <a href="https://twitter.com/DroppedBitsHQ">the Dropped Bits Twitter feed</a> as progress is made.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, you can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id922693504?pt=973725&amp;ct=dbblog&amp;mt=8">download the original version on the App Store</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One More Thing</h2>
<p>The Dropped Bits website needs some love, especially the blog. For now I&rsquo;ll be making a couple of little fixes for visual and navigation bugs, and eventually probably re-write the thing — or perhaps just move it (back) over to a hosting platform.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if anything breaks, <a href="mailto:contact@droppedbits.com">do let me know</a>!</p>
