<h1>Kind Business</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2021-03-17">17 March, 2021</time>
</span>
<p>Growing up watching my parents run a small family business made some lasting impressions on me.</p>
<p>First and foremost: the importance of taking care of your customers. They didn&rsquo;t charge a whole lot for their services, but bent over backwards to serve their customers, often working weekends, and rarely taking a vacation. While I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s especially healthy, that focus on customer service stuck with me, and evolved into a strong user advocacy in any products I&rsquo;m involved with.</p>
<p>Reinforcing this is the difference that size makes. There are excellent, caring people in every business, but I can&rsquo;t agree more with <a href="https://samwho.dev/blog/scale-is-poison/">this post</a> that as a company grows, the less likely their customers feel looked after. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scale past the number of users that you can excellently serve,&rdquo; Sam writes, and that has become a mantra for me. I don&rsquo;t want a million customers — while that would probably mean a life-changing amount of money, I couldn&rsquo;t excellently serve them all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to realize that your business is a member of a community — many communities, really. Beyond the community of customers I serve, there&rsquo;s the community of other developers whose advice and whose products make it possible for me to build my own business. There&rsquo;s the community of people in Montreal that, often behind the scenes, help keep me going.</p>
<p>I try to <a href="https://angelostavrow.blog/operating-openly">operate this business openly</a> because it lets me share as much as possible with those community. Because it builds trust. The main reason that I want to bring this business to profitability is so I can continue serving all these communities that it&rsquo;s a part of.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I&rsquo;d love to get to a point where I can (financially) give back. Justin at <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> —whose service I use to send newsletters— not only shares the business&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.notion.so/Running-Costs-f29729ded5494272947f656440967cbf">running costs</a>, but has <a href="https://www.notion.so/Funding-44491e3264854407a02457b03d5fa9df">committed to giving back 10% of profits</a> to the open-source software projects that enable the business to run. That&rsquo;s amazing, and I want to be able to do the same.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that I want Dropped Bits to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to be a business that puts its customers at the centre of its raison d&rsquo;être, and</li>
<li>to become a business that gives back whatever it can.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m really fortunate to be able to do any of this, and even more fortunate that some people are willing to pay for what I do.</p>
<p>(If you want to help me get there, consider <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/thought-detox/id1534491093">buying Thought Detox on the App Store</a>!)</p>
<p><a style="display: block; text-align: center" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/thought-detox/id1534491093"><img alt="Buy Thought Detox on the App Store" src="https://droppedbits.com/images/appstore-black.svg" style="width: 120px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="an-update-on-updates">An Update on Updates</h2>
<p>It made sense to write updates once a week as I was launching <a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/">Thought Detox</a>, but I&rsquo;m going to scale that back now to two updates per month: the usual business updates on the first Wednesday of the month, and a second update two weeks later — like this one.</p>
