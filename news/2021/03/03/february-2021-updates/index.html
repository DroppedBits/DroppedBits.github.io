<h1>February 2021 Updates</h1>
<span class="small caps">
    Posted on <time datetime="2021-03-03">3 March, 2021</time>
</span>
<h2 id="recap-february-2021">Recap: February 2021</h2>
<p>Just like last month, most of my time was spent working on launching <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/thought-detox/id1534491093">Thought Detox on the App Store</a>. This had a lot more to do with all of the <em>other</em> moving parts, besides the app: the <a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/">landing page</a>, the marketing copy, the press emails, and the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/thought-detox">Product Hunt announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the download numbers looked like for February:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://droppedbits.com/apps/honeyjar">HoneyJar</a>: 9 downloads (-55% ‚ñΩ)</li>
<li><a href="https://droppedbits.com/apps/per">Per</a>: 8 downloads (+14% ‚ñ≥)</li>
<li><a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/">Thought Detox</a>: 127 downloads</li>
</ul>
<p>Thought Detox is the only paid app; it was available for pre-order at USD$0.99 for one week, then launched on February 15 at the same price; one week later (February 22), it went up to its regular price of US$2.99 ‚Äî¬†making for Dropped Bits&rsquo; first profitable month in a <em>long</em> time!</p>
<p>Revenues and proceeds on February sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US Dollars.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenues, February 2021: USD$218 (what customers paid Apple)</li>
<li>Proceeds, February 2021: USD$178 (what Apple pays me)</li>
<li>Expenses, February 2021: CAD$129 (approximately USD$103)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t quit-your-job money, but it&rsquo;s still a far better  response to anything I&rsquo;ve launched before. <a href="https://droppedbits.com/news/2021/02/24/thought-detox-launch-update/">I wrote more about how the launch went here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="out-with-the-old">Out with the Old</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the past few updates, <strong>HoneyJar is no longer available for sale on the App Store</strong>. If you downloaded it prior to March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021, you can always download it again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that it&rsquo;s been bittersweet. HoneyJar was the first iOS app I ever launched, and I learned a lot from it. I never did much in the way of marketing, and despite that it was still downloaded around 2,800 times. But I don&rsquo;t think it ever really found its way towards product-market fit ‚Äî¬†it provided some interesting visualizations, sure, but beyond that I don&rsquo;t think its value proposition was especially interesting.</p>
<p>As a one-person &ldquo;team&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve got to be very deliberate about where I focus the scraps of time, energy, and attention that I steal from daily life, and HoneyJar frankly wasn&rsquo;t worth that investment.</p>
<h2 id="in-with-the-new">In with the New</h2>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>Thought Detox&rsquo;s launch went better than I expected</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>üì∞ It was included in <a href="https://club.macstories.net/">Club MacStories</a>&rsquo; weekly list of &ldquo;notable app debuts&rdquo; on February 19<sup>th</sup></li>
<li>üì∞ It was featured on <a href="https://www.imore.com/detox-your-mind-rumination-busting-iphone-app">iMore</a> on February 25<sup>th</sup></li>
<li>üì≤ It was downloaded 127 times in two weeks (127 units)</li>
<li>üöÄ To date, it&rsquo;s got 193 upvotes on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/thought-detox">Product Hunt</a> (come on, help me break 200!)</li>
<li>üëç It got two really great reviews on the App Store, with a total of three 5-star ratings ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be releasing a new version soon that fixes some bugs and sets the app up for translation to other languages. Check out the <a href="https://thoughtdetox.app/roadmap">public roadmap</a> to see what I&rsquo;m working on, and add your own suggestions, thoughts, and votes!</p>
